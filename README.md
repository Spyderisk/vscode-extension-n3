# Features

Provides N3 syntax checking, code themes, namespace suggestions, and N3 code execution.
The language features are based on the latest [N3 grammar](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/#grammar).


To use a code theme, open an .n3 file and select the Notation3 Light or Notation3 Dark theme (Command Palette - search "color theme").


N3 code can be executed using [eye](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye) or [jen3](https://github.com/william-vw/jen3). (Command Palette - "N3: Execute N3 Code".)
- Eye can be found [here](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye/releases) - follow the installation instructions.
- Jen3 can be found [here](https://github.com/william-vw/jen3/releases) - download the latest release and point to its path in the extension settings.  

Namespaces are suggested based on a [default file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/william-vw/vscode-extension-n3/main/namespaces.json) that is currently quite limited. You can extend this file and point to its path in the extension settings.


Please post any issues on the [github repo](https://github.com/william-vw/vscode-extension-n3).
